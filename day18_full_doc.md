## 🎯 Overview

Today, I explored how **Anomaly Detection** plays a critical role in maintaining the **safety, reliability, and trustworthiness** of AI systems and autonomous agents. Detecting unusual or unexpected behavior early helps prevent cascading failures and strengthens **guardrails** against unsafe decisions.

## 🔍 Key Concepts Explored

### 1️⃣ Types of Anomalies
- **Point Anomalies:** A single data point deviates from normal behavior.  
- **Contextual Anomalies:** Behavior is abnormal only under specific conditions or timeframes.  
- **Collective Anomalies:** A sequence of actions collectively indicates abnormal activity.  

### 2️⃣ Detection Techniques
- **Statistical:** Thresholding, Z-scores, moving averages.  
- **Machine Learning:** Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.  
- **Time-Series:** LSTM predictors for sequential data drift detection.  
- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining stats with ML to improve detection accuracy.  

### 3️⃣ Application to AI Agents
- Detecting **unexpected tool usage** or **policy violations**  
- Monitoring **model output drift** and **behavioral anomalies**  
- Identifying **potential prompt injection attacks** or **guardrail bypasses**

## 🧪 Real-World Example

- **Scenario:**  
  A grievance redressal agent suddenly rejects 3× the usual number of citizen complaints.  

- **Anomaly Detection Response:**  
  - Statistical spike detection flags the rejection rate  
  - Autoencoder highlights abnormal embedding patterns in inputs  
  - Real-time alert triggers investigation  
  - PMs review and retrain affected model components

## 🎯 Key Product Management Insight

Anomaly detection isn’t just a monitoring tool — it’s a **strategic safeguard** for AI product safety:  

- Provides **early warning signals** for agent misbehavior  
- Enhances **guardrails** by catching drift before harm occurs  
- Supports **continuous reliability** in mission-critical deployments  

Building trustworthy AI requires **proactive anomaly detection baked into architecture and user-facing safety design**, ensuring agents remain stable and aligned under real-world uncertainty.
