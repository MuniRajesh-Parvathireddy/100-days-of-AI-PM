✅ Day 5 – 🧠 Mitigating AI Hallucinations: A Strategic Deep Dive
#100DaysOfAIPM | June 27, 2025

Today, I broke down the challenge of hallucinations in LLMs — when models generate confident but false outputs. These failures risk trust, safety, and product adoption. This case study outlines a layered mitigation playbook from a PM lens.

🔍 What I explored:

Prevention: RAG, RLHF, curated datasets, and tool-augmented models

Detection: Softmax confidence, Monte Carlo Dropout, self-verification

Containment: HITL review, citations, friction UX, red teaming

Example: Einstein didn’t invent electricity → factual, supportive AI response

PM Trade-offs: Safety vs latency, cost vs control

Results: Hallucination rate reduced from 9–15% → <2%


🎯 Key PM Insight:

> Mitigating hallucinations isn’t just an AI task — it’s a product trust strategy.
Prompt engineering = UX for LLMs. Risk-aware architecture wins.

Day 6 – ✍️ Prompt Engineering Basics for Product Managers

#100DaysOfAIPM | June 28, 2025

Today, I explored how prompt engineering helps Product Managers harness LLMs more effectively — turning vague outputs into structured, strategic insights. I experimented with role-based prompts, zero/few-shot formats, and chain-of-thought reasoning to drive product ideation, user empathy, and rapid prototyping.

🔍 What I explored:

Prompt types: Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought

Role-based prompting for PM use cases

Templates for persona simulation, feature ideation, SWOT analysis

Prompt-as-UX: how phrasing shapes model behavior


🧠 Example:
"Act as a PM for a budgeting app. Suggest 3 Gen Z-focused features."
→ Output: Gamified savings streaks, AI spending coach, social finance challenges.

🎯 Key PM Insight:
Prompt engineering is the new micro-UX for AI products — a critical skill for shaping reliable, context-aware outputs that match user intent.

# 🛡️ Day 15 – AI Guardrails for Safer Agents  
**#100DaysOfAIPM | [Insert Date]**  
🔗 [LinkedIn Reflection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pmrajesh_guardrails-activity-7350570717907701760-8_t9)

Today, I explored how **guardrails** ensure AI agents stay safe, aligned, and trustworthy. From **policy filters** to **tool permissioning**, guardrails act as safety rails guiding autonomous decisions while preserving user experience.

🔍 **What I explored:**  
- Types of guardrails: input/output filters, safety classifiers, policy enforcement  
- Agent action controls: sandboxing, execution constraints  
- Human-in-the-loop and real-time monitoring  
- Balancing autonomy, safety, and UX smoothness  

🧠 **Example:**  
An AI agent attempting to process sensitive financial data → blocked by compliance guardrail → routed for human review.

🎯 **Key PM Insight:**  
Building **trustworthy AI products** isn’t just about smarter models — it’s about **designing the right guardrails** that allow safe autonomy without stifling innovation.

# 🛡️ Day 16 – Threats to AI Agents  
**#100DaysOfAIPM | [Insert Date]**  
🔗 [LinkedIn Reflection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pmrajesh_threats-to-ai-agents-activity-7350617152955035651-RiCo)

Today, I explored **security and safety risks** facing autonomous AI agents. As these agents gain autonomy, they become vulnerable to **prompt injections, data poisoning, exploitation, agentic errors, and privacy leaks**, threatening reliability and adoption.

🔍 **What I explored:**  
- Common threat vectors: prompt injection, data poisoning, model exploitation  
- Agentic risks: unsafe tool use, cascading errors  
- Mitigation: input/output sanitization, permission controls, red teaming, sandboxing  

🧠 **Example:**  
Malicious prompt → agent retrieves unauthorized data → mitigated with prompt sanitization + permission checks.

🎯 **Key PM Insight:**  
Securing AI agents is **not just technical hardening**—it’s a **trust-first product strategy** requiring layered safety and UX guardrails.

# 🥊 Day 17 – Adversarial Training for Safer AI Agents  
**#100DaysOfAIPM**  
🔗 [LinkedIn Reflection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pmrajesh_adverse-training-activity-7350953396549341184-G8ZU)

Today, I explored how **adversarial training** hardens AI agents against malicious prompts and model exploits. By training on deliberately perturbed inputs, models learn to resist manipulation and handle edge cases more robustly.

🔍 **What I explored:**  
- Adversarial attack types: prompt injection, gradient-based, data poisoning  
- Training methods: adversarial examples, robust fine-tuning, defensive distillation  
- Impact on model safety and reliability in production  

🧠 **Example:**  
Injecting hidden malicious instructions into a customer service agent → retrained with adversarial prompts → model resists exploit, responds safely.

🎯 **Key PM Insight:**  
Adversarial training isn’t just a technical safeguard—it’s a **product trust enabler**, ensuring AI agents remain resilient under real-world adversarial conditions.

# 🔎 Day 18 – Anomaly Detection in AI Agents  
**#100DaysOfAIPM**  
🔗 [LinkedIn Reflection](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/pmrajesh_anamoly-detection-activity-7351317794015105024-bQat)

Today, I explored how **anomaly detection** helps maintain the safety and reliability of AI agents. Early detection of unusual behavior prevents cascading failures, strengthens guardrails, and builds user trust.

🔍 **What I explored:**  
- Types: point, contextual, collective anomalies  
- Techniques: statistical thresholds, Isolation Forests, Autoencoders, hybrid models  
- Applications: detecting policy violations, prompt injection attacks, and behavioral drift  

🧠 **Example:**  
An AI grievance agent suddenly rejects 3× more complaints → anomaly detection flags it → alert triggers review and model retraining.

🎯 **Key PM Insight:**  
Anomaly detection is more than monitoring — it’s a **strategic safeguard** for trustworthy AI, enabling proactive safety and continuous reliability.



# 🔌 Day 19 – Solving AI Integration & LLM Infrastructure Challenges  
**#100DaysOfAIPM**

Building agentic AI systems faces two major hurdles:  
1️⃣ **Integration complexity (M × N connections)**  
2️⃣ **Scalable LLM infrastructure** for multi-agent orchestration.  

Today, I explored:  
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** A standardized communication layer using JSON-RPC, reducing integrations from M × N → M + N.  
- **LLM Infrastructure Needs:** Robust APIs, context management, retrieval systems, and multi-agent coordination to handle evolving AI ecosystems.  

🧠 **Example:**  
Without MCP → 3 models × 4 tools = 12 integrations.  
With MCP → 3 + 4 = 7 integrations, improving scalability.  

🎯 **Key PM Insight:**  
MCP + solid LLM infrastructure acts as the **USB-C and backbone for AI agents**, enabling seamless interoperability, faster development, and reliable multi-agent operations.
