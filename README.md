## ✅ 100 Days Progress Tracker


**Day 1** – 🧠 *Pinterest: Natural Language to SQL Query Generation using LLM and RAG with Vector DB*  
  Explored how Pinterest leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert user questions into SQL queries.  
  Key focus: Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to select relevant data chunks from a **vector database**, enabling precise query execution across large datasets.

🧠 Day 2 – Duolingo Max: GPT-4 Powered AI Tutor for Language Learning

Explored how Duolingo built Duolingo Max, a personalized AI tutor using GPT-4 to explain grammar mistakes and simulate conversations.
Key focus: Tackling hallucinations and vague feedback using prompt engineering, fallback templates, and safety filters — all while aligning with pedagogy.
📊 Results: 84% helpfulness, 22% feature adoption, +8% retention, <1.5% hallucinations.

✅ Day 3 – 🧠 Comparing LLMs for Governance, ESG, and Education Use Cases

Analyzed and compared 7 top LLMs (GPT-4.5, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4, Mistral S3, Cohere R+, Grok 3) from a product manager’s perspective.

Key focus: Evaluating models not just by benchmarks, but by:

⚖️ Explainability (e.g. Claude’s Constitutional AI)

🧩 PM fit (e.g. Cohere for RAG-based ESG compliance tools)

🌍 Local deployment potential (e.g. LLaMA for civic apps)

💡 Use case alignment in governance, education, and sustainability platforms

✅ Day 4 – 📘 Mapping Modern AI Architectures for Product Managers
#100DaysOfAIPM | June 26, 2025

Today, I unpack the backbone architectures behind today's leading AI systems—from language giants to vision agents. This deep dive synthesizes 8 model families—LLMs, LCMs, VLMs, SLMs, MoEs, MLMs, LAMs, SAMs—through a product management lens.

🔍 What I compared:

Core Architecture (e.g., SAMs = Prompt encoder + ViT + Mask decoder)

Deployment Context (SLMs for edge vs MoEs for scalable multi-domain)

Use-Case Fit (LAMs for workflow automation, VLMs for climate imaging)

PM Decision Factors—compute cost, latency, explainability

✅ Day 5 – 🧠 Mitigating AI Hallucinations: A Strategic Deep Dive
#100DaysOfAIPM | June 27, 2025

Today, I broke down the challenge of hallucinations in LLMs — when models generate confident but false outputs. These failures risk trust, safety, and product adoption. This case study outlines a layered mitigation playbook from a PM lens.

🔍 What I explored:

Prevention: RAG, RLHF, curated datasets, and tool-augmented models

Detection: Softmax confidence, Monte Carlo Dropout, self-verification

Containment: HITL review, citations, friction UX, red teaming

Example: Einstein didn’t invent electricity → factual, supportive AI response

PM Trade-offs: Safety vs latency, cost vs control

Results: Hallucination rate reduced from 9–15% → <2%


🎯 Key PM Insight:

> Mitigating hallucinations isn’t just an AI task — it’s a product trust strategy.
Prompt engineering = UX for LLMs. Risk-aware architecture wins.
