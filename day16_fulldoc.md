## 🔍 Threat Categories

### 1️⃣ Prompt Injection  
- Attackers manipulate model behavior via malicious instructions.  
- Example: Hidden instructions overriding safe responses.

### 2️⃣ Data Poisoning  
- Training data is tampered with to bias outputs or leak sensitive info.  
- Impacts long-term model reliability.

### 3️⃣ Model Exploitation  
- Reverse engineering weights to extract proprietary knowledge.  
- Adversarial attacks causing misclassification.

### 4️⃣ Agentic Risks  
- Autonomous agents chaining tools/actions incorrectly, causing harmful behavior.  
- Example: Financial bot making unauthorized high-risk trades.

### 5️⃣ Privacy & Data Leakage  
- Agents accidentally exposing personal or sensitive data.  
- Risk amplified with multi-agent collaboration.
